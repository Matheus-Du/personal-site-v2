While Animal Farm and 1984 are doubtlessly Orwell's best known works, I've always preferred the novels based on his experiences travelling and living with the "down-and-out" of pre-war European society. Wigan Pier is an excellent example of this work (Down And Out In Paris And London being the best of Orwell in this regard). Though the back half of this book is weighed-down by some clumsy socialist theory, it still contains many insightful glimpses into this often-overlooked aspect of British society at the time.

    The most striking aspect of this work is it's similarities to the modern day. Orwell's depiction of the plight of the English proletariat includes many observations that are present today; housing shortages force working men to live in cramped, overcrowded tenements; rising costs of basic goods which make even cheap meals expensive; faux class divides between people of similar material wealth based on decrepit ideas of class; even a predilection for sports gambling, "the cheapest of all luxuries" (pp. 82). The number of similarities between the current economic state (one of allegedly unprecedented wealth) and that of the Great Depression proves unsettling at best.
	
    It is (unfortunately) easy to see in this book the connections we retain between ourselves and our forbearers, and this proves to be Orwell's great strength in many of his books. To balk at the atrocious living standards of our great-grandparents is easy; to see them as we see ourselves - regardless of their material condition - is much harder. Wigan Pier allows us to relate to the lives presented within it's pages in a way many other contemporary novels about the working class fail to do. It is this connection that allows us to better understand our position within modern economic and sociological systems. We are not as far removed from the conditions of our coal-mining grandparents as we like to think.
