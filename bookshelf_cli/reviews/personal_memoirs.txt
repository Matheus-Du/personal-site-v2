Widely regarded as one of the best memoirs ever written, Grant's Personal Memoirs are a two-volume epic recounting the life of the American general during the Mexican-American and Civil wars. Written after Grant's terms as President and published by Mark Twain, their ability to portray - accurately and without reservation - one of the most important periods in American history has stood the test of time almost completely.

	Grant's style is succinct and without exaggeration (obviously not surprising given his military background). The result is a work valuable equally as a historical document and as a lesson in writing and communication. However, someone without an understanding of the Civil War or Grant's achievements during it's undertaking may come away feeling unimpressed. It is only with the aid of companion texts that one can understand the monumental achievements described in this work. Grant underplays his genius when describing his actions, many of which are considered some of the most impressive military achievements of the 19th century.
	
	The work is long and occasionally dry, but still invaluable in understanding the philosophy and life of one of the most important figures of the 1800s. An excellent test for one's attention span even in audiobook format, it is a rewarding read if only as an education in writing succinct yet detailed accounts and histories (and it offers much more than that).
